## Installing with CLI

It is too easy and quick to install. I recommend strongly the SVN. Firstly you must install both packages `git` and `subversion`.

### Git

* Install the package `git`;
* Clone the repository :
```shell
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/gusbemacbe/suru-plus.git /usr/share/icons/Suru++
```
* Set the icon theme:
```shell
$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme "Suru++"
```
* And do you want to keep updating?
```shell
$ cd /usr/share/icons/Suru++
$ sudo git pull
```

### Subversion

Run SVN like a Millennium Falcon with coaxium than Git, less than 10 parsecs:

```shell
sudo svn export --force https://github.com/gusbemacbe/suru-plus/trunk/ /usr/share/icons/Suru++
```

## Changing the folder colour

Please visit directly the tutorial: [Suru++ Folders](https://github.com/gusbemacbe/suru-plus-folders). The tutorial is translated in 7 languages.

## Known bugs

### This icon theme do not apply correctly the apps icons

Some apps, as AppImage-built, Snap-built and dpkg-installed apps do not use relative path or relative icon. They use absolute path. Other apps use misleading icon name, for example, GitHub Desktop uses the `Icon=desktop`.  

### Some icons are not applied correctly and look bad in KDE

Since this new version is officially supported for KDE, please report the misdisplayed icon to m that I will analyse and fix. 

## Report

* Do you find the missed icons?
* Do you find the misused icons?
* Did you find the errors?

Report, but please provide well-detailed informations. Or I will have difficulty to understand what you are saying or to know which app you are referring.

## Contribution
